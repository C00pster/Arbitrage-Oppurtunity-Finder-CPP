Arbitrage Oppurtunity Finding Algorithm

This algorithm takes data from the Binance API and finds oppurtunity for Triangular Arbitrage using the Bellman-Ford Algorithm

NOTE: 
- The API performance has been sub-par at best
- If you get an error that says "Failed to initialize IO", please try to run again. I have been having issues recieving a response from the endpoint used in that function and waiting 2 seconds and trying again has worked every time I get this error.
- If you are still experiencing issues, please reference the mp4 provided as proof of it working.
- Due to the nature of market prices, I can't guarantee that an arbitrage oppurtunity will be found, but the video provided did find one.
